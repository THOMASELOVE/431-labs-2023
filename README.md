## (optional) Lab X

[Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/) has its own [little website](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/). We strongly encourage you all to take a look as soon as you can.

## Getting Help During The Lab

You are welcome to discuss each Lab with Professor Love, the teaching assistants or your colleagues, but your answer must be prepared by you alone. Don't be afraid to ask questions, using any of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/contact.html) page.

## An Important Note

Your response to **every** question, unless we explicitly say that is isn't required in the instructions, should include at least one complete English sentence responding to the question. Code alone is not a sufficient response, even if the code is correct. Some responses might not need any code, but every response needs at least one complete sentence.

## Submitting Your Work

Each set of Lab instructions provides details on how to submit your work. Mostly, this is done through the Assignments folder in [Canvas](https://canvas.case.edu/), but check the instructions.

## Grading

- Labs 1-7 are graded by the TAs and then reviewed by Dr. Love. Your grades will be available approximately one week after the Lab deadline. 
- Dr. Love reviews the [Lab X](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-labX/) personally.
 
**Grades on Labs** (and our records about minute papers) appear as they become available in the 431 Grades Roster. 
  - You'll receive instructions to access this document after Lab 1's grades are available.

## Answer Sketches and Grading Rubrics

As each Lab passes its deadline (as listed in the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html)), we will:

- post the answer sketch (posted 48 hours after the deadline) to our Shared Google Drive, and then
- post grades and any additional information about grading rubrics one week after the deadline to a location we will provide to you.

## Late Policy (No extensions)

- Note that your lowest lab score (out of Labs 1-7) over the course of the semester will be dropped before we calculate your lab grade.
- To receive full credit on a Lab, it must be received on Canvas no later than 59 minutes after the posted deadline. (This allows for small issues with uploading to Canvas to occur without penalty.)
- Labs that are turned in 1-12 hours after the deadline will lose 10% of available points.
- Labs turned in more than 12 but less than 48 hours after the deadline will lose 30% of available points.
- No extensions to Lab deadlines will be permitted this semester. Labs turned in more than 48 hours after the deadline will receive no credit, since by then the Lab Sketch will be posted.

## Lab Regrade Requests will be reviewed in December

The [Lab Regrade Request Form](https://bit.ly/431-lab-regrade-form-2023) will open after Lab 1's grades are posted. 

We use this form to handle almost all grading errors and regrade requests on Labs. The only exception to this policy is when you believe we've made an arithmetic error in summing up your points on a lab. If that happens, just email Dr. Love to get it straightened out. The Form is used for all other regrade situations.

- Essentially, if you want Dr. Love to review your grade on one (or more) of our Labs, fill out the Lab Regrade Request Form anytime before 2022-12-08 at noon, as specified on the [Course Calendar](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-2023/calendar.html). 
- Later, when all course work has been graded, Dr. Love will open the form. If you have requested additional points that could change your course grade, he'll review your request. If not, then he won't. 
- Visit [this section of the Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2023/11_grading.html#lab-appeal-policy---request-a-review-via-google-form) for more details on this policy.
